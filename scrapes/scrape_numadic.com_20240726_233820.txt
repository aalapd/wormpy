In addition to any other remedies it may have, either party may also terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) daysâ notice (or without notice in the case of nonpayment), if the other party materially breaches any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement. Customer will pay in full for the Services up to and including the last day on which the Services are provided.
