Frequently asked questions
How much does Imagination Machine invest in a project?
We invest on average €200k in the exploration phase, including co-founders fees. If the project is market validated, Imagination Machine will be able to invest up to an additional €500k.
What’s the deal for an Entrepreneur-in-Residence at Imagination Machine?
First, you’re on a freelance mission to explore the opportunity and assess whether or not it’s promising enough to lead to the creation of a business. We pay you for this research, depending on your profile.
If the market opportunity is validated, Imagination Machine provides the financing needed to create a company & first round of seed financing. You then become a cofounder of the company (together with the other entrepreneur/s-in-residence) without needing to invest financially.
How do you form co-founder teams?
We are pragmatic 🙂 We decide to start working with an entrepreneur-in-residence when we feel like there’s a great fit. And if, together, we believe there’s a need for another co-founder, we look for that rare pearl together. The first co-founder is therefore part of the “recruitment” team.
I have a startup project, can I be supported by Imagination Machine for its development?
Yes of course! Our startup studio model allows us to create teams to take charge of opportunities identified by us and/or to finance existing startups in the early stages that excite us.
Where is the studio based?
You can join Imagination Machine wherever you are; we work remotely. We meet at least every 2 months to spend time together and encourage exchanges between projects. And if you like office life, we offer offices in Nantes and Paris as a start.
Changing the world and launching your startup won’t be a lonely process 🙂

Entrepreneur-in-residenceSubmit your project
#1 objectiveCreate the conditions for your project's success: Imagination Machine provides the initial funding, we activate our operating team and mobilize our community & network of partners.
Our methodologyInspired by design thinking, our methodology is fundamentally pragmatic: we adapt to each project, each team. We proceed by successive iterations to learn more and more about a sector, its users, its habits. Together, we look for the best solutions to boost your startup's long-term growth.
1.ExploreFrom a good idea to a startup…Your mission: validate the market opportunity and choose a positioning (duration: 3 to 4 months).
With our dedicated user research & ideation team, you’ll conduct many user interviews and test several value propositions. You’ll build a vision for the project. If we jointly validate a market opportunity, we’ll create the company together, with you as co-founder.
2.BuildFrom 0 to 1Your mission: launch the project on the market and confirm its potential to scale up (duration: 3 to 6 months)
Together we launch the “prototyping” phase (MVP): our team dedicated to the 0 to 1 process -product, designer, developers, etc.- works with you in iterative stages to find THE formula that works with customers. You are in the driver seat structuring operations: you develop the Product Market Fit, create the BPs, success metrics and pitch decks, participate in sales strategy and brand creation, build the network of partners,…
3.DevelopFrom a startup to a scaleupYour mission: develop & grow to maximize impact! (duration: 6 to 12 months)
After 12 to 18 months on the project, your objective is to create the conditions for rapid growth, while maintaining the initial values of the startup: agility, transparency, responsibility and positive impact.
On your agenda: recruitment of the first employees, business & operations, possible fundraising and relations with your investors.
Our expertiseYou start with an operational team - all with an expert and entrepreneur profile - dedicated to your project from day 1.

Where do we work?
We work remotely : you can join Imagination Machine wherever you are! You can also choose to work in our offices, in Nantes or Paris. If necessary, we can assist you in obtaining visas, our studio being certified French Tech Visa.
And we meet up at least every 2 months to spend time together. Paris, New York, Barcelona, ​​Milan, Annecy, Nantes,…
The Imagination Machine community is large and solid: changing the world and launching your start-up will not be a solitary process 🙂
What happens if the exploration phase is unsuccessful?
The project stops. If we’re all up for continuing to work together, the co-founder(s) may eventually find a job in an existing startup or start another project as an entrepreneur-in-residence.
I am interested in one of your projects, but I have no experience in this sector. Can I apply?
Yes ! Your previous experience interests us because it has shaped you.
Depending on the talents already present on a project, we are led to look for all types of profiles to complete a team.

Les Mini Mondes, the saga to discover the world !
Les Mini Mondes’ journey started from a devastating observation: the toy industry in France creates 75,000 tonnes of waste per year, the toys are mostly made in China, and most of them are out of step with contemporary ideas about gender. The team looked into the subject and decided to shake things up a little.
Mission accomplished: Les Mini Mondes introduces children aged 1 to 11 to the world! Oscar and Sacha, our two heroes, travel the world behind the wheel of their van. They are cool, fun, and inspiring.
Children follow their adventures in magazines, by subscription or individually purchased andevery stop leads to a total immersion in a country of the world with stories, games, recipes, etc. Toys associated with the stories are made in France from recycled plastic, and include cards, board games, books… And still come? Play areas (first opening in 2023) and a first animated series (fingers crossed).
Les Mini Mondes’ mission is to awaken children’s curiosity, open them to the world, and get them moving while showing the whole industry we can make fun products while promoting local manufacturing and recycled materials !
Le Mini Mondes have quickly established themselves as an important player in the world of children’s toys and entertainment, and its goal is to become a worldwide phenomenon, with our 2 little adventurers the heroes of all children!

Sustainable Development Goals04.Quality educationThe Duchemin family, at the heart of Les Mini Mondes story, sets out to discover all the countries in the world and to meet local characters. The story dispenses with stereotypical character associations like firefighters for boys and princesses for girls. It’s intended to be non-gendered, inclusive, and to offer a responsible and caring pedagogy.
12.Responsible consumption and productionLes Mini Mondes produces its toys from recycled PLA (waste from the production of yogurt trays) and recycled PP (plastic bottles) and recovers its defective products to produce new parts.

UpTogether trains managers, HR and employees in daily coaching techniques
The impetus? The majority of companies have the technical skills and expertise on their team, but they often lack a culture of collaboration to adapt and perform at their best. UpTogether was created to significantly improve interactions and collaboration within businesses.
Helping managers adopt positions of support, optimizing communication between different divisions/professions, UpTogether strives to respond to specific issues in organizational structure through a collaborative program. The program combines individual coaching and collaborative coaching. It involves integrating coaching techniques through application, together and on a recurring basis, in situations encountered by learners. UpTogether strives both to work on self-knowledge for each learner and to provide everyone with the tools and techniques to work better together.
Some of UpTogether’s clients are BNP Paribas Cardif, the Chamber of Trades and Crafts, Pernod Ricard and Leroy Merlin.

BlueCare discovery, marine biotechnology startup, to prevent and treat neurodegenerative diseases
BlueCare discovery develops microalgae “active ingredients” for precision medicine. We develop innovative medical treatments that are effective and environmentally friendly.
The field of application of innovative bioactive compounds from microalgae is considerable for the Health sector; they could, for example, prevent Alzheimer’s disease. With its proprietary platform, BlueCare will ultimately be able to offer solutions in the nutraceutical, biomedicine, dermato-cosmetics, and animal health sectors, helping to develop the enormous potential of the microalgae sector.
“We draw inspiration from the oceans and their immense biodiversity to develop innovative medical treatments: effective and respectful of the environment. The active ingredients developed are stable and effective for patients, without disturbing the environment once they have been eliminated by the body."Benoît Serive

We want to make Care & Repair an everyday reflex
Our mission at Prolong is to extend the life of products on the market. To achieve this, we help brands make Care & Repair an experience as magical as the act of buying. It’s an exciting challenge, with such high potential!
Prolong is the B2B SaaS platform that enables brands and retailers to orchestrate Care & Repair services on a global scale, leveraging data and network effects seamlessly. With Prolong, brands can enhance the post-purchase customer experience and generate new revenue, while significantly reducing their environmental footprint.
The exploration phase began at the end of 2022. Prolong will be available on the market in autumn 2023, with 2 top customers already on board.
“Based on my idea around repair, we spent 6 months with the studio interviewing players in the sector, testing value propositions, etc. I appreciate the team's operational commitment and the strategic exchanges to make Prolong the #1 B2B player in Care & Repair.”Tanguy Frécon

Sustainable development goals12.Responsible consumption and productionAt Prolong, we want to change the figures that "hurt":
• On average, a person buys 40% more clothes than 15 years ago, and keeps them half as long (Ademe)
• 82% of textiles categorized as “waste” can actually be cleaned or repaired for reuse (Ellen McArthur Foundation)
08.Decent work and economic growthProlong, helping f the circular economy:
• The textile industry is one of the most polluting in the world, generating +4 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year, and it is the world's 3rd largest consumer of water (source: Ademe).
• Extending the life of clothing by 9 months would reduce the environmental footprint by 20-30%

The essential complement of care for those in poor health… and their companies
Zest for Life helps companies build more inclusive and productive work environments where every employee thrives.
The startup supports not only sick individuals but also caregivers and managers in the challenges they face.
A science recognized by the medical world, serving businesses
Zest for Life offers customized, multidisciplinary support programs based on Therapeutic Patient Education to assist affected individuals beyond medical care.
This science, originating from the hospital environment, allows patients to learn how to live well with their illness, thereby reducing its impact on their daily lives.
Mission accomplished for the 2,000 people supported and 700 professionals trained : we observe a 50% increase in return to work, a 35% decrease in sick leaves, and a 27% decrease in depression rates.
“After the birth of my son, I was convinced that my next adventure would be to launch a startup with a positive impact, but I had neither a specific topic nor a partner. That's why I turned to Imagination Machine. From our first interactions, I was captivated by the team and the methodology. The spark happened when they introduced me to Elodie and her desire to spread Therapeutic Education. Zest for Life was born, and 1.5 years later, it’s still a joy to work together and see this project come to life!”Alice du Verne

New • Ecotourism
Let’s reinvent the holiday resort
When it comes to vacationing, more and more families are opting for close-to-home destinations, direct connection to nature, local food, and authentic experiences all while being conscientious about their carbon footprint. At Imagination Machine, we’re convinced that ecotourism provides business opportunities with major impact potential.
Is it possible to help ecotourists rewild in nature? Can we reinvent the vacation village for a sustainable future? Whether it’s slow tourism, rewilding, passive housing, glamping (glamorous camping), or a farm stay, we intend to explore and consider the full range of possibilities for imagining a different kind of tourism offering, one that’s sustainable, responsible toward the planet, and meaningful for the public.
